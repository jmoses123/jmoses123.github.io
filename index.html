       <h2>info about dogs</h2>
        <p>Getting dogs out of the shelter system as quickly as possible is always a key goal for companion animal advocates. Once a dog enters a shelter, they often lose out on a full spectrum of socialization, may be more likely to catch a communicable disease, may experience a range of stress from various sources, and may otherwise languish for days, weeks, or years. What’s more, sometimes dogs who have been adopted out will be returned to the shelter, if they aren’t a fit with their new home.  With 3.9 million dogs entering the shelter system in the U.S., the problem is a serious one.</p>

       <h2>how long does a dog sleep?</h2>
        <p>The average amount of sleep for adult dogs is 12–14 hours per day, although it really depends on a number of factors, such as breed and age.<br>Unlike people, who are usually awake all day, then sleep at night, dogs don’t have a regular sleep regimen. They catch several short naps during the day.

        <h2 id="hello-h2">tips to take care of your dog</h2>
   <!-- website has br instead of li because I need more paragraphs -->
        <p>Feed your dog a high quality dog food. Read the label of a prospective food.The first couple ingredients should be some kind of meat, not meat by-product or a grain. This will help you know that the food is high in good protein, not just filler.
Ask your veterinarian for food recommendations. Your vet may be able to steer you towards a food that is just right for your pup and he or she may also have recommendations for how much to feed the dog.Make sure you have a good, reliable veterinarian. A good way to choose a vet is to see if he or she answers your questions promptly and knowledgeably and to see how they interact with your pet. You will need to bring your dog for regular check-ups, so if your vet is too booked up you may want to look for a new one. Feel free to change veterinarians even after you take your dog to one.
Remember, you should also know of an emergency vet that's open 24 hours a day and on weekends.Brush your dog. The frequency of brushing will vary widely, depending on what type of dog you have and how much it sheds. Brushing your dog regularly will help to reduce shedding and it gives you a chance to assess the state of your dog's body. Your aim is to keep the coat in good condition and knot free. For this you may need a combination of comb and brush, to prevent knots and groom out tangles.
If your dog sheds a lot, pet stores and Walmart sell shed-control shampoo. Bathe shedding dogs once a week until shedding reduces. </p>

         <h2>how much do you pay each month for a puppie?</h2>
       <p><img id="image1" src="https://www.what-dog.net/Images/faces2/scroll0015.jpg" alt="picture of puppy" width=203>
       The total first-year cost of owning a dog is $1,270 and for a cat it’s $1,070.

    As you can see, having a pet can cost you over $1,000 in the first year, and well over $500 each additional year. Depending on the food you buy and sudden medical expenses, the costs could be much higher. Furthermore, these tables are not inclusive. If you travel, tack on pet sitting or kennel services, and if you rent an apartment, expect to pay a sometimes no refundable pet deposit or cleaning fee, if your landlord allows animals at all.

           The Texas Society of CPAs has a PDF version of a pet budget worksheet you can use to help you estimate pet ownership costs. While the page is geared at parents teaching kids the costs involved in pet ownership, the actual worksheet is universal, and could be useful in trying to determine what your actual pet ownership costs might be.

    These figures take into account having pet health insurance, which many pet owners do not. If your animal gets sick and you do not have insurance, vet bills can quickly escalate into the thousands of dollars. If you don’t have pet insurance, then potential pet costs are another reason to have an emergency fund of at least several thousand dollars.
